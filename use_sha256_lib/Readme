sha256_lib.h
sha256_lib.c 	
	A simple implmentation of SHA256, mostly generated by Chat GPT.
	You should not change anything in these files!
	The following two applications/driver programs show how to use it in your programs.


sha256_driver.c	
	A simple driver program showing how to use sha256_lib. 
	It takes a command line argument and computes/prints its sha256 hash value.
	e.g., > sha256_driver clean_text@abc.123.com


convert2sha256.c 
	Another driver program using sha256_lib to convert a plain text file to sah256 hash file!
	It takes at least two command line arguments:
	 	input file name containign clear/plain text username:password lines 
		output file name, which will contain username_sha256:password_sha256 after the run
	You will be using the output file  as input file for your server program (see Readme in parent dir)

	Here is how you can use it to generate a file sha256 hash values: 
 	e.g., > convert2sha256 ../credentials0-plain.txt ../credentials0-sha256.txt 

   	../credentials0-sha256.txt is a very short file for your server to use for a quick check 
	as we also  provide its plain text version!

	However, your server program should be able to handle larger files. 
	For example, ../credentials1-sha256.txt is created for you from a very large plain text file
	by taking the first 10^6 entries! Then we removed plain text due to security and privacy concerns.
